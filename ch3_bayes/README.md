# Bayesian Classification and GMMs in Speech Recognition

This is a collection Jupyter Notebooks on Classification for the course [Speech Recognition](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp33776) (Master Artificial Intelligence) at KU Leuven.

## Goals of the exercise

Within this exercise we make use of the "Generative, Bayesian" Framework in which the data is modeled  by a Gaussian  Mixture. (For course notes on this topic, see  http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~compi/H02A6/course_notes/html/ch3_classification )
The different exercises all make use of the same paradigm and apply it to gradually more complex situations by increasing the dimensionality of the featuresand increasing the number of classes.

The work involves: data processing, data exploration, data modeling, building the classifier, testing the classifier.

In this folder you find 4 notebooks:
- [BayesGMM]       A very brief refresh on Bayes formula and GMMs (skip if you know it)
- [Hillenbrand-1]  Gender Classification with Pitch as Feature
- [Hillenbrand-2]  Vowel Classification with Formant Features
- [TIMIT-1]        Vowel Classification from a single frame with FBANK or MFCC features
