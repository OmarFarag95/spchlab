## Exercises

Within these chapter classification of speech (single frame or segment) is tackled with a Bayesian approach.

In these exercises we work with real speech data and high dimensional features as evidence.

In the first part (TIMIT-1) we gradually more complex situations by increasing the dimensionality of the features and increasing the number of classes.

We explore both a generative approach with GMMs and a discriminative approach with Neural Nets



- [TIMIT-1]         Vowel Classification from a single frame with FBANK or MFCC features

- [TIMIT-2]         Vowel Classification from segments of data using Deep Neural Nets
