They do this by looking up the index of the word in a weight matrix $\\mathbf{E}$, which is often called the embedding matrix. By training the embedding matrix jointly with the rest of the language model, the resulting word embeddings will have some interesting properties: several syntactic and semantic relationships are encoded as vector offsets in the embedding space.

The output of the neural network is given to a **softmax** function, which converts the output values (also called logits) to values between 0 and 1. The sum of those values is 1, and thus the output of the softmax function can be treated as a probability distribution.

To find the most probable word, we look for the maximum probability. In practice, we usually work with **log probabilities**, because if we are computing the probability of a sequence of words, the multiplication of all probabilities easily becomes very small. Converting the probabilities to the log domain and summing them instead of multiplying alleviates this problem.
